                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>In search of new experiences, I moved to Ireland with my family in 2012 and was able to further develop my adaptability to a different culture. In 2016 i moved to Germany where i manage to learn a new language in only a few months. I discover Python for a few months and now i am very excited to apply what i have learned.</p>

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>I believe that I am open minded and I love sharing knowledge with anyone that wants my help. I love interacting with people and I always speak my mind.Python has a simple syntax that makes it suitable for learning programming as a first language. I have started with a few youtube videos, than i took partnon the curse Python for Beginners organised by SAP where I gained my first Cerification. After that I started with a more complex curse on Udemy: 100 Days of Code (The complete Python Pro Bootcamp) by Der Angela Yu.</p>
